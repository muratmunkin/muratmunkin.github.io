 I am a Bayesian econometrician whose work in econometric theory is primarily motivated by the needs of applied researchers, especially in health economics. As a result, most of the produced papers are the interplay between the empirical work and the econometric theory, with each guiding the other. I am a researcher who does empirical research himself including programming in Matlab, who knows the substantive field of health economics as well as produces work in theoretical econometrics and computational methods. This rare combination allows me to construct econometric methods that are closely aligned with the needs of empirical researchers.

My main research interests are in applied Bayesian Microeconometrics, however, the work that I have published is diverse, including econometric theory (both Bayesian and frequentist), empirical health economics, labor economics, education economics, development economics, computational statistics, and Islamic finance. An important part of my work uses Bayesian econometric methods to evaluate endogenous treatment effects in various limited dependent variable models with emphasis on count data and applications in empirical health economics.
