Dr. Munkin is a Bayesian econometrician who knows the substantive field of Health Economics and who has a general interest in Applied Microeconomics. His work is primarily motivated by the needs of applied researchers. As a result, most of the produced papers are the interplay between the empirical work and the econometric theory, with each guiding the other. He is a researcher, who does empirical research himself, including data handling and programming in Matlab, and who produces work in theoretical econometrics and computational methods. This combination allows him to construct econometric methods that are closely aligned with the demands of empirical researchers.

His main research interests are in applied Bayesian Microeconometrics, however, the work that he has published is diverse, including Bayesian and frequentist econometric theory, empirical health economics, labor economics, education economics, development economics, computational statistics, and Islamic finance. An important part of his work uses Bayesian econometric methods to evaluate endogenous treatment effects in various limited dependent variable models with emphasis on count data and applications in health economics.
