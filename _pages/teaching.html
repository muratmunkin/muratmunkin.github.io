<p>The complete list of classes which I have taught is given in my CV but the main courses in my teaching portfolio can be divided into graduate and undergraduate <b>Econometrics</b>, <b>Health Economics</b> and <b>Mathematical Economics</b>.</p>

<p>I have been working on a textbook, titled <b>Constructive Econometrics I</b>. The book is a self-contained one-semester introduction to Econometrics theory and application written for graduate students in Economics and related fields, consisting of 10 chapters.</p>
<p>First, it covers fundamentals of probability theory and statistics deriving most of the stated results and enhancing understanding of the subject with various analytical and computational problems and their solutions. Then the textbook integrates these fundamentals with Econometrics theory and application in the context of linear regression analysis.
</p>
<p>Secondly, this book presents both closed-form and simulation-based methods of model estimation. Simulation-based methods, Bayesian and Classical, deal with intractable distributional forms in mostly nonlinear models, which arise in applications when making assumptions consistent with data, departing from basic models and their convenient closed-form solutions. In addition to presenting the philosophical differences between alternative estimation methods, the textbook is rather pragmatic and computational modern showing how these methods may complement each other when solving empirical problems.
</p>
<p>Finally, the book puts particular emphasis on building programming skills that help students work independently of statistical packages, typically designed to treat only a narrow range of models and estimation methods. All examples and exercises in this book have code in Matlab, which comes with detailed line-by-line explanations. Like their knowledge of probability theory, statistics and simulation-based methods, programming skills also serve as a basis for more advanced courses in Econometrics and studentâ€™s own research.
